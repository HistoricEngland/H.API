# ACCEPTED Candidate Term Status Report Guidance
SchemeConcept data validation errors are reviewed by Historic England as *Candidate Terms* on behalf of the [Forum on Information Standards in Heritage (FISH)](https://heritage-standards.org.uk/)   [FISH Terminology Working Group](https://heritage-standards.org.uk/working-groups/). A *Candidate Term* is a term (e.g. “Ice cream factory”) that has been used locally in a dataset (e.g. Westshire HER) but has not yet been incorporated into the relevant scheme (e.g. the [FISH Thesaurus of Monument Types](https://heritagedata.org/live/schemes/eh_tmt2.html) ). More information on controlled vocabularies, the FISH thesauri and Candidate Terms is documented [here](https://heritage-standards.org.uk/terminology/). 

ACCEPTED Candidate Terms are reported <specify frequency> to all data providers. This report contains the following information to help ensure data providers are aware of new additions to the schemes maintained by the FISH Terminology Working Group. 

Updated schemes are typically made available on an annual basis and will be downloadable from https://heritage-standards.org.uk/terminology/
