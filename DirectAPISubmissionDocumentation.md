## Overview

This document outlines the steps required to submit Heritage Gateway Record (HGR) compliant records to Historic England (HE) via a RESTful API provided by HE using OAuth authentication.

## Authentication

### Obtaining an Access Token

- **Endpoint**: `https://provider.historicenglandservices.org.uk/api/auth/token/create`
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Headers**: 
  - `Content-Type: application/json`
- **Body**:
  ```json
  {
    "username": "your_username",
    "password": "your_password"
  }
  ```
- **Response**: A JSON object containing the `access_token` required for file submission.
  ```json
  {
    "access_token": "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN",
    "token_type": "Bearer",
    "expires_in": 3600
  }
  ```

## Batch Creation

To initiate the record submission process, begin by generating a new submission batch. This is achieved by submitting the current counts of monument records to the designated endpoint. Upon successful submission batch creation, the system will return a unique submission `BATCH_ID`. This `BATCH_ID` must be included in all subsequent API requests related to the current submission batch. You can break down the process of sending data by making multiple requests to the API, but all requests should contribute to the same submission batch. For example,  if you have created submission batch with `batch_id:427` and intend to submit 404,010 records using requests with 100 records each, you would send 4,041 API requests â€” all using `batch_id:427`. Note that for each new submission, a fresh submission `BATCH_ID` is required. This necessitates the resubmission of the latest monument record counts to generate a new submission `BATCH_ID` . Ensure that the counts are updated accurately with each new submission batch.

### Record Counts Explained
**Total Count**: The total number of monument records in your entire dataset. \
**Published Count**: The number of published (not private) monument records in your entire dataset. \
**Submitted Count**: The number of records to be submitted in the current submission batch.

### Creating a New Batch

- **Endpoint**: `https://provider.historicenglandservices.org.uk/api/batch/create`
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Headers**:
  - `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN`
  - `Content-Type: application/json`
- **Body**:
  ```json
  {
    "total_count": integer,
    "published_count": integer,
    "submitted_count": integer
  }
  ```
- **Response** A JSON object containing the `batch_id` required for record submission.
  ```json
  {
    "batch_id": "BATCH_ID"
  }
  ```

## Batch Submission

Each batch should exclusively contain records that have either been newly created or updated since the submission of the previous batch. This ensures that the data collected in subsequent batches is the freshest and most relevant, minimizing redundancy and focusing exclusively on recent changes or additions.

### Submit Batch

- **Endpoint**: `https://provider.historicenglandservices.org.uk/api/batch/submit`
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Headers**: 
  - `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN`
  - `Content-Type: application/json`
- **Body**:
```json
  {
    "batch_id": "BATCH_ID",
    "records": [
      {...},
      {...},
      ...
    ]
  }
  ```
  - Include the records as an array of HGR compliant JSON objects within the JSON body.

### Finalise Batch Submission

After successfully submitting all records, the next step is to finalise the batch submission. This process confirms and completes the current batch, ensuring all records within it are processed. Once a batch is finalised, no further records can be added to it.

- **Endpoint**: `https://provider.historicenglandservices.org.uk/api/batch/finalise`
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Headers**:
  - `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN`
  - `Content-Type: application/json`
- **Body**:
  ```json
  {
    "batch_id": "BATCH_ID"
  }
  ```

### Steps

1. Obtain an access token from the OAuth endpoint.
2. Construct a POST request to the batch creation endpoint with the appropriate headers and batch details.
3. Process the API's response to retrieve the BATCH_ID for the newly created batch.
4. Prepare the records for submission according to the API's specifications.
5. Construct a POST request to the batch submission endpoint with the appropriate headers, BATCH_ID and data.
6. Process the API's response to determine the success or failure of the submission.
7. Once all records are submitted send a POST request to finalise the batch submission.

### Examples of cURL Commands

```bash
curl -X POST https://provider.historicenglandservices.org.uk/api/auth/token/create \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username": "your_username","password": "your_password"}'
```

```bash
curl -X POST https://provider.historicenglandservices.org.uk/api/batch/create \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"total_count": 100, "published_count": 50, "submitted_count": 30}'
```

```bash
curl -X POST https://provider.historicenglandservices.org.uk/api/batch/submit \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"batch_id": BATCH_ID, "records": [{...}, {...}, ...]}' \

```

```bash
curl -X POST https://provider.historicenglandservices.org.uk/api/batch/finalise \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"batch_id": "BATCH_ID"}'
```

## Error Handling

- **401 Unauthorized**: Your access token is invalid or expired.
- **400 Bad Request**: The request is improperly formatted.
- **413 Payload Too Large**: The payload size exceeds the allowed limit.
- **500 Internal Server Error**: An unexpected error occurred on the server.
